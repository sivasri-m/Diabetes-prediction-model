# Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning

This project is a web-based diabetes prediction system that utilizes machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of diabetes based on medical input data. It is built with a robust preprocessing pipeline, an XGBoost classifier, and a user-friendly web interface using Flask, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

- Comprehensive data preprocessing (missing values, outliers)
- Feature engineering (categorical binning and one-hot encoding)
- RobustScaler for handling outliers during scaling
- Trained with multiple models â€” XGBoost selected for best performance
- Web-based prediction interface using Flask
- Artifacts saved for deployment and real-time inference

## Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree (CART)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost (selected model)
